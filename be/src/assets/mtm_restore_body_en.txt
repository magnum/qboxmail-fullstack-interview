Hello {{NOME_WHMCS}},
the user **{{EMAIL_UTENTE}}** has logged into the Mail Time Machine and requested the restoration of his mailbox with the **{{DATA_BACKUP}}** backup.
With this operation we will restore all the messages present in the indicated backup, without deleting any messages that have been received or sent from the mailbox in the meantime.
The restore operation has a cost of â‚¬ 50.00 + VAT.

Do you confirm the restore operation?

Backups are kept on our systems for 15 days. After this date it will not be possible to restore the contents of the mailbox.
If you have a monthly plan you will find the 'restore backup' item directly in the next proforma invoice.
If you have an annual plan, you will receive the recovery proforma invoice in the next few hours.
For more information on Mail Time Machine and Backup please read the Documentation.
